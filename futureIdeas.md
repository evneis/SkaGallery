# Ideas for the future
- Upvote/Downvote system with /top and /bottom commands
- Random image of the day
    - maybe replace /random with this
- Search by sender
    - If I do this - should I update sender information when a dupe is sent?
- User profiles/stats
    - how many images/gifs each person sent
- Firebase - categorizing based on file type
- ~~Add reply functionality so users can delete or untag an image~~

- Down the line - maybe some automated "last year today"
